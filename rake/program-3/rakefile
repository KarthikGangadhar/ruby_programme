# Because rake is not like Method Overriding (LOL) . It will add those task as well.

# That's okk who might we can see how many task rake know about

# rake --tasks or rake -T

# as i told you that it will give the list of task available , but what happened to this

# for that we need to desc the task for.


desc 'Print hello task'
