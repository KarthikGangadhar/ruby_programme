# If you checkout the GitHub repository for Rake, you will see it describes Rake as:
# "make-like build utility for Ruby."
# And, unless you know what Make is, that description is probably not all that helpful.
# The Rake tutorial describes Rake as:
# A build tool, written in Ruby, using Ruby as a build language."

#
# Okay, so now we’ve seen the “build” term a lot, but again, if you are not familiar with Make,
# you are probably not too familiar with what a build tool/utility is. I believe the Wikipedia
# article for Rake does a better job summarizing it: ""A software task management tool. It allows
# you to specify tasks and describe dependencies as well as to group tasks in a namespace.""

# But, now we’ve replaced one vague term, build tool, with another: task management tool.
# Because of that, I think we need a more helpful description; while not as succinct as those
# given above, here’s how I like to describe Rake:
#
# 1: Rake lets you define tasks
# 2: Tasks can depend on other tasks
# 3: Tasks are only run if needed
# 4: Tasks are only run once
#
# But, we still need a definition for tasks. Since you define your tasks in Ruby, your tasks can do
# anything that you can do in Ruby. Which means you can do pretty much anything you want in your
# tasks – problematically speaking.

## A simple way of writing  a rake task

task :hello

## rake hello

## As we don't hae any action so it wont do anything.
