desc "Create foo file"
file "foo" do
  touch "foo"
end

# yes!!! here we tell rake command utility to run touch command to create a file.

# rake -T
# rake foo
# ls
# rakefile foo => yup!! the file os do exists


# ok lets fo one step further and trigger some command utility
# ls -lt rakefile => -rw-rw-r-- 1 vinay vinay 0 Sep  6 00:48 foo

# rake foo
# rake foo
# rake foo
# rake foo
# rake foo
# rake foo

# ls -lt rakefile => -rw-rw-r-- 1 vinay vinay 0 Sep  6 00:48 foo
# Even we run rake task man a times but timestamp doest changed what that about.
# Tasks are only run if its needs to be run. and file task has special meaning in rake. If file doest exists
# then the action will run if the file exists then the action wont get run. AS we are not updating our file
# the action wont run.

# Now trigger the shell command for the same file.  touch command  :P
# touch foo
# ls -lt foo => -rw-rw-r-- 1 vinay vinay 0 Sep  6 00:54 foo
# Now the  update timestamp has been changed because linux utility touch method has different as compare to
# rake touch method.
