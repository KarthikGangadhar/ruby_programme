# I’ll go more in-depth with Rake’s domain-specific language (DSL) in future posts,
# but just to cover our bases, here’s a simple example:

# task is method which take only one argument as a name; name can be in String or Symbol.

task :hello do ## task "hello"
  p 'Hello Rake Task !!!'
end

## rake hello

## Global Tasks

# Typically, Rake tasks are defined per project, by writing the task definitions in the Rakefile,
# placed in the root directory of your project. But, that’s not the only place you can define Rake
# tasks; Rake does let you define global tasks, these global tasks can be run from any directory – even
# those that do not have a Rakefile in their hierarchy.

# Step: 1
# The first step is to make the ~/.rake directory where the task definition files will reside

# Step: 2
# mkdir ~/.rake

# Step:3
# Next create the file for the task definitions,
# the file’s name does not matter, but it must the have .rake extension:
# touch ~/.rake/hello.rake

# Step: 4
# Add tasks to newly created file just like you would in any Rakefile;
# I’ll use our above hello task as an example:
# $ echo -e 'task "hello" do\n  puts "Hello, World"\nend' > ~/.rake/hello.rake

# Step: 5
# Invoke global task, the -g flag is the important part:

# rake -g hello
# Hello, World
