## Concurrency vs. Parallelism

# Concurrent: existing, happening, or done at the same time
# Parallel: occurring or existing at the same time or in a simple way
# Hmm, ok. Well, that hasn't improved our thinking about these two topics.
# We need to dig deeper into how the world of computing applies to these words.
# Rather than looking at the abstract, let's instead consider some real world examples.


# A “Real World” Example


# Let's say you've sat down for the evening to complete tomorrow's homework.
# This evening you've got both Math and History worksheets to fill out.
# Tonight for some reason, you decide to do one problem in Math, then one problem in History,
# then back to Math, etc until all the problems are done.
# Now, clearly you the reader can see a problem here. By switching back and forth,
# completing your homework will probably take longer than if you did the complete
# Math worksheet then did the History worksheet. In other words, if you did the
# worksheets in serial.

# So, if concurrent means “having multiple outstanding tasks at once”, then what is parallel?
# Parallel is the ability to make progress on multiple tasks simultaneously.
# Let's say you've been asked to read the book One O'Clock Jump by Lise McClendon.
# You also need to drive down to San Diego for Comic-Con. Thankfully you find that
# One O'Clock Jump is available on audiobook!  You can now listen to the book while driving.
# You're simultaneously making progress on two separate tasks. This is the equivalent of parallelism in computing.
